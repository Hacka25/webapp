# Project Overview
This project is a cloud-based application that utilizes Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Cloud SQL to deploy a web application. The following sections provide an overview of the project's architecture, components, and configuration.

### Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

*   GKE Cluster: A GKE cluster is created using the `main.tf` file, which defines the provider and region for the project.
*   Cloud SQL Instance: A Cloud SQL instance is created using the `sql.tf` file, which defines the instance name, database version, and IP configuration.
*   Deployment: A deployment is defined in the `k8s/deployment.yaml` file, which deploys a web application with two replicas. The deployment uses the `cloudsql-proxy` container to connect to the Cloud SQL instance.

### Configuration

The project uses several configuration files to define the architecture and components:

*   [output.tf](output.tf): This file defines output values for the GKE cluster name and the Cloud SQL instance connection name.
*   [variables.tf](variables.tf): This file defines variables for the project ID, region, GKE cluster name, database user, and database password.
*   [sql.tf](sql.tf): This file defines the Cloud SQL instance settings and IP configuration.
*   [main.tf](main.tf): This file defines the provider and region for the GKE cluster.
*   [k8s/deployment.yaml](k8s/deployment.yaml) and [k8s/service.yaml](k8s/service.yaml): These files define the deployment and service configurations for the web application.

### Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets that illustrate key implementation details:

```terraform
output "gke_cluster_name" {
  value = google_container_cluster.primary.name
}
```

This snippet defines an output variable for the GKE cluster name.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

This snippet defines a deployment for the web application.

### Mermaid Diagrams

Here is a Mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of traffic between the GKE cluster, Cloud SQL instance, and external clients:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A(GKE Cluster) -->|Deployment|> B(Containers)
  B -->|ContainerPort 8080|> C(External Clients)
  C -->|Request|> D(Cloud SQL Instance)
  D -->|SQL Query|> E(Cloud SQL Database)
  E -->|Response|> F(Containers)
  F -->|ContainerPort 3306|> G(External Clients)
```

This diagram shows the flow of traffic from external clients to the web application, which is deployed in the GKE cluster. The containers in the deployment communicate with the Cloud SQL instance and database using the `cloudsql-proxy` container.

### Tables

Here is a table that summarizes the key features of the project:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GKE Cluster | A Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster is created to deploy the web application. |
| Cloud SQL Instance | A Cloud SQL instance is created to store data for the web application. |
| Deployment | A deployment is defined in the `k8s/deployment.yaml` file to deploy the web application with two replicas. |
