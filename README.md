Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a professional README.md for their project based on the provided source code files. First, I need to understand what each file does and how they interact.

Looking at the files, there's a Terraform project with several resources. The main.tf uses Google provider, and there are resources for GKE cluster, SQL database, and Kubernetes deployment and service. The variables.tf defines some defaults, and the outputs in output.tf are linked to those resources.

The key components here are the Terraform resources: the GKE cluster, the SQL database instance, and the Kubernetes deployment/service. The README needs to explain what the project does, the components, installation steps, special features, and maybe some insights into the files.

First, the project likely provisions a GKE cluster, a MySQL database instance, and a Kubernetes deployment with a service. The user might be deploying a web application that connects to the database through the service.

In the README, I should start with a brief project description. Then, break down the components: GKE cluster, SQL database, Kubernetes deployment. Explain each component's role. Installation steps would involve initializing the Terraform, applying the configuration, and checking the resources. Special features might include the use of Google Cloud's services, maybe the use of a specific SQL instance, or the LoadBalancer service type.

The file insights: in the output.tf, the cluster name is set to the primary GKE cluster, and the SQL instance's connection name is used. The variables.tf has defaults for project_id and region, with the GKE cluster name and database user/password. The SQL database is set up with specific settings, like tier and IP configuration. The main.tf uses the variables, and the k8s files are for deploying the application.

I need to make sure the README is comprehensive but not too verbose. Also, mention the sensitive variables like db_password, so users know to handle them securely. Maybe include steps for setting up the project, like creating the necessary resources in the Google Cloud Console.

Check for any special configurations, like the use of a specific SQL instance, the cloudsql-proxy in the deployment, and the LoadBalancer service. Also, note that the deployment uses a secret for the DB password, which is handled via the k8s service.yaml.

Make sure to structure the README with sections: Project Description, Key Components, Installation/Running, Special Features, File Insights. Use technical terms but keep it clear. Avoid markdown in the README but the user wants a README.md, so use proper markdown headers.

Double-check that all the files are covered in the insights. For example, the k8s/deployment.yaml uses the SQL instance's connection name in the env variables. The volumes in the deployment are mounted to read the credentials.

Also, mention that the project is for deploying a web app with a MySQL database on GKE, using Terraform. The user might need to set up the project ID and region, and maybe create the necessary resources in the Cloud Console.

Potential issues: the user might not have the necessary permissions, or they need to handle the secret management. But the README should guide them through the setup steps without assuming they have all the prerequisites.

Alright, putting it all together now.

# **GKE + MySQL Database Deployment with Terraform**  
**Project Description**  
This project uses Terraform to provision a fully functional Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with a MySQL database instance, and a Kubernetes deployment that connects to the database. The setup includes:  
- A managed GKE cluster with a node pool  
- A MySQL database instance configured for cloud-native use  
- A Kubernetes deployment with a LoadBalancer service to expose the web application  
- Secure credential management via Terraform variables and Kubernetes secrets  

---

## **Key Components**  
### 1. **GKE Cluster**  
- **Role**: Manages the Kubernetes nodes and provides a scalable environment for the application.  
- **Configuration**:  
  - Cluster name: `web-app-cluster`  
  - Node count: 2 (initial)  
  - Machine type: `e2-medium`  
  - Node pool: `primary-node-pool` (configured for cloud SQL proxy)  

### 2. **MySQL Database Instance**  
- **Role**: Hosts the application's database, with:  
  - Instance name: `mysql-db`  
  - Database version: `MYSQL_8_0`  
  - IP configuration: `projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default`  
  - Tier: `db-f1-micro`  
  - User: `admin` (managed via `google_sql_user` resource)  

### 3. **Kubernetes Deployment**  
- **Role**: Runs the web application, connecting to the MySQL database.  
- **Configurations**:  
  - Deployment name: `web-app`  
  - Replica count: 2  
  - Environment variables:  
    - `DB_HOST`: `127.0.0.1`  
    - `DB_USER`: `admin` (from Kubernetes secret `db-credentials`)  
    - `DB_PASSWORD`: `sensitive` (managed via Terraform variables)  
  - Cloud SQL Proxy:  
    - Uses `PROJECT_ID:REGION:mysql-db` for connection  
    - Credential file: `/secrets/service_account.json` (mounted from volume `sql-creds`)  

### 4. **Service & Load Balancer**  
- **Role**: Exposes the web application to the internet.  
- **Configurations**:  
  - Service type: `LoadBalancer`  
  - Port: `80` (target port: `8080`)  
  - Selector: `app: web`  

---

## **Installation & Running**  
### 1. **Setup**  
- **Prerequisites**:  
  - Google Cloud account with proper permissions (Project ID, Cloud SQL, Kubernetes Engine)  
  - Terraform installed (â‰¥ 1.0)  
  - `gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest` (replace with your custom image)  

### 2. **Apply Configuration**  
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 3. **Verify Resources**  
- Check GKE cluster and node pool:  
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters list
  ```
- Confirm MySQL instance and database:  
  ```bash
  gcloud sql instances list
  ```
- Validate Kubernetes deployment and service:  
  ```bash
  kubectl get deployments
  kubectl get services
  ```

---

## **Special Features & Configurations**  
- **Secret Management**:  
  - `db_password` is managed via Terraform variables and stored in Kubernetes secrets.  
  - `cloudsql-instance-credentials` is mounted as a volume to the Cloud SQL proxy.  
- **Security**:  
  - Node pool uses `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` for access.  
  - Deployment uses `readOnly: true` for the SQL credentials volume.  
- **Scalability**:  
  - Deployment replicas: `2` (high availability)  
  - GKE cluster: `remove_default_node_pool = true` (prevents accidental deletion)

## **File/Function Insights**  
### `output.tf`  
- **Purpose**: Outputs dynamic values (e.g., cluster name, SQL instance connection name).  
- **Key**:  
  - `gke_cluster_name` = `web-app-cluster` (default)  
  - `sql_instance_connection_name` = `mysql-db` (default)  

### `variables.tf`  
- **Purpose**: Centralize configuration variables.  
- **Key**:  
  - `project_id`: Required for Cloud resources  
  - `region`: Default: `us-central1`  
  - `gke_cluster_name`: Default: `web-app-cluster`  
  - `db_user`: Default: `admin`  
  - `db_password`: Sensitive, managed via Terraform variables  

### `sql.tf`  
- **Purpose**: Defines the MySQL database instance.  
- **Key**:  
  - `tier`: `db-f1-micro` (cost-effective for development)  
  - `ip_configuration`: Uses `projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default` for private network access.  

### `main.tf`  
- **Purpose**: Governs the Terraform stack.  
- **Key**:  
  - Uses `google` provider with `project` and `region` variables  
  - Initializes resources based on `var.project_id` and `var.region`  

### `k8s/deployment.yaml`  
- **Purpose**: Deploy the web application.  
- **Key**:  
  - Uses `db-credentials` secret for `DB_PASSWORD`  
  - `cloudsql-proxy` connects to `mysql-db` via `instances=PROJECT_ID:REGION:mysql-db=tcp:3306`  

---

## **Troubleshooting Tips**  
- **Permissions**: Ensure `gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest` is accessible.  
- **Secrets**: Use `terraform apply` to update the Kubernetes secret `db-credentials`.  
- **Logs**: Check GKE logs via `kubectl logs` or `gcloud container nodes list`.

## Architecture Diagram

```mermaid
<think>

First, I need to understand the components involved. The files mentioned are output.tf, variables.tf, sql.tf, main.tf, gke.tf, and k8s/deployment.yaml and k8s/service.yaml. 

Looking at the output.tf, there are two outputs: gke_cluster_name and sql_instance_connection_name. These are set using variables in the Terraform files. The variables.tf has project_id, region, gke_cluster_name, db_user, and db_password. The gke_cluster_name is default to "web-app-cluster", and db_user and db_password are set with default values.

In the sql.tf, there's a Google SQL database instance named "mysql-db" with settings. The user resource is a Google SQL user with the same instance name and password. The main.tf uses the project and region variables.

The gke.tf defines a Google Container Cluster and a node pool. The node pool has two nodes with machine type e2-medium and some OAuth scopes. The main.tf's provider is set to use var.project_id and var.region.

The k8s/deployment.yaml has a Deployment with two replicas, a container named app, and another container cloudsql-proxy. The env variables include DB_HOST, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD. The cloudsql-proxy uses a secret called db-credentials, which is referenced via a volumeMounts. The service.yaml is a LoadBalancer service for the web-app.

Now, the user wants a Mermaid graph that represents this architecture. The graph should show the main components: Terraform variables, resources, and Kubernetes components.

The variables.tf defines the variables, which are used in the resources. The sql.tf creates a SQL instance and a user. The gke.tf creates a GKE cluster and node pool. The k8s/deployment.yaml has a deployment and service. The service.yaml is the LoadBalancer.


1. Variables: project_id, region, gke_cluster_name, db_user, db_password.
2. SQL Resources: google_sql_database_instance, google_sql_user.
3. GKE Resources: google_container_cluster, google_container_node_pool.
4. Kubernetes Resources: deployment, service.

The connections should show how these components are linked. For example, the variables are used in the resources, the SQL instance is part of the GKE cluster, the deployment uses the SQL instance's connection, and the service points to the deployment.


Wait, the user mentioned "high-level architecture diagram", so it's about the overall structure rather than detailed components. So the nodes would be:

- Variables
- SQL Database Instance
- SQL User
- GKE Cluster
- GKE Node Pool
- Kubernetes Deployment
- Kubernetes Service

Then, the arrows would show how these components are connected. For example, variables are used in the resources, the SQL instance is part of the GKE cluster, the deployment uses the SQL instance's connection, and the service points to the deployment.


Now, putting this into Mermaid syntax. The graph should start with the variables, then the resources, then the GKE, then the Kubernetes components. The arrows should connect them appropriately.

Also, the user wants only valid Mermaid syntax, no extra text. So I need to avoid any explanations or extra content.

Let me structure the nodes and arrows properly. The variables are the starting point, then the resources, then the GKE cluster and node pool, then the Kubernetes deployment and service.

The final Mermaid code should look like this:

graph TD
    A[Variables] --> B[SQL Database Instance]
    B --> C[SQL User]
    A --> D[GKE Cluster]
    D --> E[GKE Node Pool]
    D --> F[Deployment]
    F --> G[Service]


So the arrows should be:

A --> B
B --> C
C --> D
D --> E
E --> F
F --> G

But maybe the nodes should be more detailed. For example, the SQL Database Instance is part of the GKE cluster, which is connected to the Deployment. The Deployment has the Service.

Alternatively, the graph could be:

variables --> sql_instance --> gke_cluster --> gke_node_pool --> deployment --> service

But in Mermaid, the nodes need to be properly connected with arrows.

I think the correct way is to have the variables as a node, then the SQL resources, then the GKE resources, then the Kubernetes resources. The arrows connect them in the order of their usage.

So the final Mermaid code would be:

graph TD
    A[Variables] --> B[SQL Database Instance]
    B --> C[SQL User]
    A --> D[GKE Cluster]
    D --> E[GKE Node Pool]
    E --> F[Deployment]
    F --> G[Service]


I think that's the correct structure. Now, translating this into the Mermaid syntax with the correct labels and arrows.
</think>

graph TD
    A[Variables] --> B[SQL Database Instance]
    B --> C[SQL User]
    A --> D[GKE Cluster]
    D --> E[GKE Node Pool]
    E --> F[Deployment]
    F --> G[Service]
```
