# Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive overview of the architecture, components, and data flow within the provided source files. The main objective is to explain how different components interact with each other to achieve specific tasks.

### Introduction

The project consists of multiple Terraform modules (output.tf, variables.tf, sql.tf, gke.tf) and Kubernetes configuration files (k8s/deployment.yaml, k8s/service.yaml). These files work together to create a GKE cluster with a MySQL database instance, deploy two applications (web-app and frontend), and configure services for load balancing.

### Architecture

The architecture can be divided into three main components:

*   **GKE Cluster**: The project creates a GKE cluster using Terraform (gke.tf). This cluster is used to run containers.
*   **MySQL Database Instance**: A MySQL database instance is created using Terraform (sql.tf) and integrated with the GKE cluster. The database instance is used by both applications.
*   **Applications**: Two Kubernetes deployments (k8s/deployment.yaml and k8s/backend-deployment.yaml) are used to deploy the web-app and frontend applications, respectively. These applications communicate with each other using services.

### Data Flow

The data flow in this project can be summarized as follows:

1.  The web-app and frontend applications send requests to the MySQL database instance.
2.  The MySQL database instance processes these requests and returns results to the applications.
3.  The applications use these results to generate HTML responses, which are then served by their respective services.

### Code Snippets

Here is a code snippet from k8s/deployment.yaml:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
This code snippet defines a Kubernetes deployment for the web-app.
