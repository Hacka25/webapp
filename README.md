# Project Overview

**Introduction**
The "Project Overview" page provides a comprehensive overview of the project's infrastructure, architecture, and components. This page is designed to serve as a starting point for understanding the project's overall structure and how its various parts interact with each other.

### Architecture Overview
The project consists of several key components:

* **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**: A managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
* **Cloud SQL**: A fully managed database service that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases.
* **Kubernetes Deployments**: Used to manage the scalability and availability of application containers.

### GKE Cluster
The project utilizes a single GKE cluster, named `web-app-cluster`, which is located in the `us-central1` region. The cluster is configured with one node pool, `primary-node-pool`, containing two nodes. Each node runs the `e2-medium` machine type and has access to the following resources:
	* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`

### Cloud SQL Instance
The project utilizes a single Cloud SQL instance named `mysql-db`. This instance is configured with a MySQL 8.0 database and supports connections via TCP port 3306.

### Kubernetes Deployments
Two deployments are used in this project:

* **Web App Deployment**: Deploys the web application container, which listens on port 8080.
* **Backend Deployment**: Deploys the backend service container, which also listens on port 8080. This deployment utilizes a cloudsql-proxy container to establish connections to the Cloud SQL instance.

### Services
Three services are used in this project:

* **Web App Service**: A load-balanced service that exposes port 80 and directs traffic to the web app container.
* **Backend Service**: A headless service that allows for service discovery and exposure of port 8080. This service is used by the backend deployment.
* **Frontend Service**: A load-balanced service that exposes port 80 and directs traffic to the frontend container.
