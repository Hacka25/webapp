# Project Overview
### Introduction
This project overview provides a comprehensive understanding of the infrastructure and architecture used in this cloud-native application. The project involves creating a scalable, secure, and highly available web application using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.

- [k8s/frontend-service.yaml](k8s/frontend-service.yaml)

### Architecture
The application architecture is based on a microservices design, with multiple services communicating with each other using RESTful APIs. The services are deployed to separate Kubernetes (K8S) clusters:

* **Frontend**: Handles user requests and serves as the entry point for users.
* **Backend**: Handles business logic and interacts with databases.
* **Cloud SQL Proxy**: Enables secure communication between the application and Cloud SQL instances.

### Data Flow
Data flows from the frontend to the backend, which then communicates with Cloud SQL instances. The application uses environment variables and secrets to manage sensitive information such as database credentials.

### Code Snippets
```terraform
output "gke_cluster_name" {
  value = google_container_cluster.primary.name
}

resource "google_sql_database_instance" "mysql_instance" {
  name             = "mysql-db"
  database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
  region           = var.region

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
    ip_configuration {
      private_network = "projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default"
    }
  }
}
