This technical documentation will provide an overview of the project and its architecture. The project is a web application hosted on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and uses Google Cloud SQL as the database system. The application consists of frontend, backend services, and a deployment for each. 

## Architecture
The architecture can be represented with the following flowchart:
```mermaid

    A[Client] -->|Request| B[Load Balancer]
    B -->|Forward| C[Frontend Service]
    C -->|Internal Request| D[Frontend Deployment]
    D -->|Internal Request| E[Backend Service]
    E -->|Internal Request| F[Backend Deployment]
    F -->|Database Connection| G[Cloud SQL Proxy]
    G --> H[Database]
```
Sources: [output.tf:1-2](), [sql.tf:1-7](), [main.tf:1-4](), [gke.tf:1-6](), [k8s/deployment.yaml:3-19](), [k8s/service.yaml:3-7](), [k8s/backend-service.yaml:3-7](), [k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml:3-9](), [k8s/backend-deployment.yaml:3-12]()

## Components
The main components of the project are:
*   GKE Cluster - Hosts the frontend and backend services. (Sources: [main.tf:1-4](), [gke.tf:1-6]())
*   Cloud SQL Instance - Stores application data. (Sources: [sql.tf:1-7]())
*   Kubernetes Deployments - Defines the pods that make up the frontend and backend services. (Sources: [k8s/deployment.yaml:3-19](), [k8s/backend-deployment.yaml:3-12]())
*   Kubernetes Services - Exposes the frontend and backend services to the internet or other parts of the cluster. (Sources: [k8s/service.yaml:3-7](), [k8s/backend-service.yaml:3-7]())

## Data Flow
The data flow can be represented with the following sequence diagram:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as C
    participant LoadBalancer as B
    participant FrontendService as FS
    participant FrontendDeployment as FD
    participant BackendService as BS
    participant BackendDeployment as BD
    participant CloudSQLProxy as CP
    participant Database as D

    C->>B: Request
    B->>FS: Forward request
    FS->>FD: Internal request
    FD->>BS: Internal request
    BD->>BS: Internal request
    BS->>CP: Database connection request
    CP->>D: Forward to database
    D-->>CP: Response
    CP-->>BD: Response
    BD-->>FS: Response
    FS-->>B: Response
    B-->>C: Response
```
Sources: [output.tf:1-2](), [sql.tf:1-7](), [main.tf:1-4](), [gke.tf:1-6](), [k8s/deployment.yaml:3-19](), [k8s/service.yaml:3-7](), [k8s/backend-service.yaml:3-7](), [k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml:3-9](), [k8s/backend-deployment.yaml:3-12]()

## Conclusion
This project is a web application hosted on GKE using Cloud SQL as the database system. It has a clear architecture with separate components for frontend and backend services, and it uses Kubernetes deployments to manage the pods that make up these services. The data flow is well-defined through sequence of internal requests between the components.
