# Project Overview
Based ONLY on the content of the [RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]:

### Architecture and Components

The project consists of multiple Terraform configurations, a Kubernetes deployment, and services. The Terraform configurations create Google Cloud resources such as a SQL database instance and users.

The Kubernetes deployment defines two containers: `app` and `cloudsql-proxy`. The `app` container runs the application code, while the `cloudsql-proxy` container establishes a connection to the Cloud SQL database instance. The deployment uses a secret volume to store the Cloud SQL credentials.

### Data Flow

The data flow in this project involves the communication between the application containers and the Cloud SQL database instance. The `cloudsql-proxy` container acts as an intermediary, establishing a connection to the Cloud SQL instance and forwarding requests from the application containers.

The above diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the project, showing how Terraform configurations create a Google Cloud resource (the SQL database instance) and how the `cloudsql-proxy` container connects to this instance.

### Code Snippets

```terraform
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "mysql_instance" {
  name             = "mysql-db"
  database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
  region           = var.region

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
    ip_configuration {
      private_network = "projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default"
    }
  }
}
```

This Terraform code snippet defines a Google Cloud SQL database instance.
