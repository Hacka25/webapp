<summary>Project Overview</summary>

**Introduction**
"Project Overview" is a comprehensive project that demonstrates the integration of multiple cloud providers, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure. The project focuses on deploying a scalable web application with a MySQL database instance using GCP's Cloud SQL service.

### Architecture

The architecture consists of three main components:

* **Cloud SQL**: A managed MySQL database instance deployed in GCP.
* **Containerized Application**: A web application containerized using Docker and deployed to Kubernetes (GKE) clusters.
* **Load Balancer**: A load balancer service configured to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the web application.

### Components

The project includes several key components:

* **Google SQL Database Instance**: The MySQL database instance is created using GCP's Cloud SQL service, with settings for tier, private network, and IP configuration.
* **Kubernetes Deployment**: A Kubernetes deployment is configured to create two replicas of the web application container, with environment variables set for DB_HOST, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD.
* **Cloud SQL Proxy**: A cloud SQL proxy container is used to connect to the Cloud SQL instance from within the Kubernetes cluster.
* **Secrets Management**: Secrets management is handled using Kubernetes secrets, which store sensitive information such as database credentials.
