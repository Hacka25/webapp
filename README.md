Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a README.md for their project based on the provided source code files. I need to make sure it's professional, technical, and comprehensive. Let me start by understanding what each file does.

First, looking at the files:

- **output.tf** has outputs for GKE cluster name and SQL instance connection name. These are probably used in the deployment or configuration files.
- **variables.tf** defines variables like project_id, region, GKE cluster name, DB user, and password. The default values are set, so maybe the project is set to a specific region, and the cluster is named "web-app-cluster".
- **sql.tf** creates a Google SQL database instance with specific settings. The user has a default region, and the instance is named "mysql-db".
- **main.tf** uses the Google provider, sets the project and region, and probably references the other resources.
- **gke.tf** defines the GKE cluster and node pool. The node pool has 2 nodes, machine type e2-medium, and some scopes.
- **k8s/deployment.yaml** is a Kubernetes deployment for a web app. It uses the environment variables from the SQL instance, mounts a volume for credentials, and uses the cloudsql-proxy.
- **k8s/service.yaml** is a service that uses LoadBalancer, selects the app, and ports 80.

So, the project is a Kubernetes deployment that uses Google Cloud services. It's a web app with a MySQL database, using GKE for the cluster and CloudSQL for the database. The deployment includes the app container, a cloudsql-proxy, and a service.

Now, the README needs to cover:

1. What the project does: Deploy a web app with MySQL using GKE and CloudSQL, with specific configurations.
2. Key components: The variables.tf defines the project and region, sql.tf creates the database, gke.tf sets up the cluster, deployment.yaml and service.yaml handle the Kubernetes setup.
3. Installation and running: Use terraform to apply the resources, set variables, apply the terraform plan, then deploy with kubectl.
4. Special features: The use of sensitive variables (db_password), the cloudsql-proxy with credential volume, the LoadBalancer service.
5. File insights: Output.tf's outputs, variables.tf's defaults, sql.tf's settings, gke.tf's node pool, deployment.yaml's env variables, service.yaml's LoadBalancer.

I need to avoid placeholders and make sure it's specific. Let me structure the README with sections:

- Project Overview
- Key Components
- Installation & Running
- Special Features
- File/Function Insights

For each section, elaborate with details. Make sure to mention the variables, the cluster setup, the deployment, and the service. Also, note the sensitive data handling, like the db_password being in the variables but not exposed.

Check for any potential issues: The project uses a default region, so maybe the user should set it if needed. The cloudsql-proxy is mounted with a secret, which is handled in the deployment.yaml.

I need to ensure that the README is clear and technical, not just a list. Use examples where possible, like the default values in variables.tf. Also, mention the required Terraform modules and the steps to apply them.

# GKE & CloudSQL Web App Deployment

---

## Project Overview

This project leverages **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to deploy a scalable web application with a MySQL database. It uses **Terraform** to manage infrastructure as code, integrating **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** for container orchestration and **CloudSQL** for persistent storage. The solution includes:

- A **GKE cluster** with a node pool configured for high availability.
- A **MySQL database instance** managed via CloudSQL.
- A **Kubernetes deployment** with a load-balanced service to expose the web application.

---

## Key Components

### 1. **Terraform Variables**
- `project_id`: The GCP project ID for resource creation.
- `region`: Default region (`us-central1`) for all resources.
- `gke_cluster_name`: Default GKE cluster name (`web-app-cluster`).
- `db_user`: Default MySQL user (`admin`).
- `db_password`: Sensitive password stored in a secret (configured via `variables.tf`).

### 2. **CloudSQL Database**
- **Resource**: `google_sql_database_instance.mysql_instance`
  - Name: `mysql-db`
  - Region: `var.region`
  - Database version: `MYSQL_8_0`
  - IP configuration: `projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default` (private network)
  - User: `google_sql_user.users` (created via `sql.tf`)
  - Password: Managed via `db_password` (not exposed in logs)

### 3. **GKE Cluster & Node Pool**
- **Resource**: `google_container_cluster.primary`
  - Cluster name: `var.gke_cluster_name`
  - Node pool: `google_container_node_pool.primary_nodes`
    - Node count: 2
    - Machine type: `e2-medium`
    - Oauth scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`
    - Private network: `projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default`

### 4. **Kubernetes Deployment**
- **Resource**: `k8s/deployment.yaml`
  - Deployment name: `web-app`
  - Replica count: 2
  - Environment variables:
    - `DB_HOST`: `127.0.0.1` (points to CloudSQL)
    - `DB_USER`: `db-credentials.username` (from secret)
    - `DB_PASSWORD`: `db-credentials.password` (from secret)
  - CloudSQL proxy:
    - Command: `"/cloud_sql_proxy"`, with instance `PROJECT_ID:REGION:mysql-db=tcp:3306`
    - Volume mount: `/secrets` (read-only secret `cloudsql-instance-credentials`)

### 5. **Kubernetes Service**
- **Resource**: `k8s/service.yaml`
  - Service type: `LoadBalancer`
  - Selector: `app: web`
  - Port: `80` (targetPort: `8080`)

---

## Installation & Running

### 1. **Initialize Terraform**
```bash
terraform init
```

### 2. **Apply Configuration**
```bash
terraform apply
```

### 3. **Verify Deployment**
- Check GKE cluster and node pool:
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters get-credentials web-app-cluster --region us-central1
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
- Confirm CloudSQL instance:
  ```bash
  gcloud sql instances describe mysql-db --region us-central1
  ```

### 4. **Access Application**
- The web app is exposed via a LoadBalancer service, accessible at:
  ```
  https://<load-balancer-ip>/web-app
  ```
  (Replace `<load-balancer-ip>` with the actual IP from `gcloud` commands.)

---

## Special Features

- **Sensitive Data Handling**: `db_password` is stored in a secret (not exposed in logs or outputs).
- **Security**: 
  - Node pools use `e2-medium` (balanced performance and cost).
  - CloudSQL proxy uses a service account with `cloud-platform` scope for secure access.
- **Scalability**: Deployment supports 2 replicas for high availability.
- **Auto Scaling**: Not explicitly configured, but can be added via `kubectl autoscale` or Terraform.

---

## File/Function Insights

### 1. **output.tf**
- Outputs:
  - `gke_cluster_name`: Name of the GKE cluster (`web-app-cluster` by default).
  - `sql_instance_connection_name`: Connection name for the CloudSQL instance (`mysql-db` by default).

### 2. **variables.tf**
- Default values:
  - `region`: `us-central1` (can be overridden).
  - `gke_cluster_name`: `web-app-cluster` (can be renamed).
  - `db_user`: `admin` (can be customized).

### 3. **sql.tf**
- Database instance setup:
  - Uses `db-f1-micro` tier (cost-effective for small workloads).
  - IP configuration ensures private network access to the database.

### 4. **gke.tf**
- Cluster and node pool configuration:
  - `remove_default_node_pool`: Ensures no default nodes are retained.
  - `initial_node_count`: 1 node (minimizes initial resource usage).

### 5. **k8s/deployment.yaml**
- Environment variables:
  - `DB_HOST`: Points to the CloudSQL instance (`127.0.0.1`).
  - `db-credentials` secret is mounted as a volume (`sql-creds`) for the proxy.

---

## Configuration Notes

- **Project ID**: Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` in `k8s/deployment.yaml` with your actual GCP project ID.
- **Region**: Default is `us-central1`. Change via `var.region` if needed.
- **Security**: Ensure the service account used by the CloudSQL proxy has proper IAM roles (e.g., `sqladmin`).

---

## Deployment Best Practices

- **Secret Management**: Use `terraform secrets` or `vault` for managing `db_password` in production.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Add `terraform apply` to CI pipelines for automated deployments.
- **Monitoring**: Use `gcloud` or `kubectl` to monitor cluster and service health.
