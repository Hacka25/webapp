# Project Overview
Based ONLY on the content of the [RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]:

## Introduction

This project is an infrastructure deployment for a web application using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Kubernetes, and cloud services. The project aims to create a scalable and secure environment for hosting a web application with a MySQL database instance.

The provided files include Terraform configuration files (`output.tf`, `variables.tf`, `sql.tf`, `main.tf`) for provisioning GCP resources, such as a MySQL database instance, and Kubernetes deployment (`k8s/deployment.yaml`) and service (`k8s/service.yaml`) configurations for deploying the web application.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of:

### Infrastructure Setup

*   A Google Cloud SQL instance with a MySQL database named `mysql-db`
*   A GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) cluster named `web-app-cluster` in the `us-central1` region
*   A cloudsql-proxy container in the deployment to connect to the MySQL database instance from within the cluster

### Web Application Deployment

*   A web application deployment with two replicas, using the `gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest` image and exposing port 8080
*   The deployment sets environment variables for the web application:
	+ `DB_HOST`: set to `127.0.0.1`
	+ `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD`: retrieved from a Kubernetes secret named `db-credentials`

### Service Configuration

*   A service named `web-app-service` that exposes port 80 and targets port 8080 in the deployment
*   The service is configured as a LoadBalancer, allowing incoming traffic to be routed to the web application

### Database Access

*   The cloudsql-proxy container is used to connect to the MySQL database instance from within the cluster
*   The proxy uses a credential file named `service_account.json` to authenticate with the database instance
