# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to deploy a scalable web application using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Cloud SQL. The scope of the project includes creating a GKE cluster, deploying a web application with a frontend and backend tier, and connecting to a Cloud SQL instance.

### High-Level Architecture

The architecture of the project consists of three main components:

*   **GKE Cluster**: A GKE cluster will be created to deploy the web application. The cluster will have multiple nodes, each running a specific role (e.g., worker node).
*   **Cloud SQL Instance**: A Cloud SQL instance will be created to store and manage database data. The instance will be connected to the GKE cluster using a cloudsql-proxy container.
*   **Web Application**: The web application consists of two tiers: frontend and backend. The frontend tier handles user requests, while the backend tier processes and generates responses.

### Detailed Components

1.  **GKE Cluster**:
    *   A GKE cluster named `web-app-cluster` will be created in the `us-central1` region.
    *   The cluster will have one node pool with two nodes, each running a specific role (e.g., worker node).
2.  **Cloud SQL Instance**:
    *   A Cloud SQL instance named `mysql-db` will be created in the `us-central1` region.
    *   The instance will run MySQL 8.0 and have a private IP configuration.
3.  **Web Application**:
    *   The web application consists of two tiers: frontend and backend.
    *   The frontend tier is responsible for handling user requests and sending them to the backend tier.
    *   The backend tier processes and generates responses, connecting to the Cloud SQL instance using a cloudsql-proxy container.
