# Project Overview

## Introduction
The project overview aims to provide a concise introduction to the overall project, highlighting its purpose and scope. The following sections will delve into the architecture, components, data flow, and logic of the project.

[Main.tf](main.tf) provides the foundation for this project by setting up Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) providers.

## Architecture
The project architecture consists of multiple layers:

### GCP Layer
[sql.tf](sql.tf) creates a Google SQL Database Instance named `mysql-db` with a tier of `db-f1-micro`. This instance is set up to run in the specified region and utilizes private networking. Two resources, `google_sql_user` and `google_sql_password`, are used to create database users and passwords.

### AWS Layer
No specific architecture or components are mentioned for the AWS layer.

### Kubernetes (K8s) Layer
[k8s/deployment.yaml](k8s/deployment.yaml) defines a Deployment named `web-app`. This deployment consists of two containers: `app` and `cloudsql-proxy`. The `app` container uses an image from Google Container Registry (GCR) and sets environment variables for the database connection. The `cloudsql-proxy` container is used to connect to the GCP SQL instance.

[k8s/service.yaml](k8s/service.yaml) defines a Service named `web-app-service`, which exposes port 80 and targets port 8080 in the `web-app` deployment.

### Data Flow
Data flows from the database instances created in [sql.tf](sql.tf) to the containers in the K8s deployment. The `app` container uses environment variables set by the `cloudsql-proxy` container to connect to the GCP SQL instance.

### Logic
The logic of the project involves setting up a scalable and secure infrastructure for a web application using GCP and AWS. The K8s deployment is used to manage the containers and ensure high availability.

This flowchart represents the data flow and connections between the GCP SQL instance, CloudSQL proxy, app container, and K8s service.

## Tables
| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [variables.tf](variables.tf) | Defines variables for project ID, region, GKE cluster name, DB user, and passwords. |
| [sql.tf](sql.tf) | Creates a Google SQL Database Instance and sets up database users and passwords. |

## Code Snippets
```terraform
output "sql_instance_connection_name" {
  value = google_sql_database_instance.mysql_instance.connection_name
}
```

This code snippet defines an output variable that returns the connection name of the GCP SQL instance.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: DB_HOST
          value: 127.0.0.1
```

This code snippet defines a K8s Deployment with two replicas and sets environment variables for the database connection.
