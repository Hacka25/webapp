# Project Overview
Based ONLY on the content of the [RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]:

### Introduction

This project is a combination of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Kubernetes-based infrastructure. It consists of a MySQL database instance, a GKE cluster with a web application deployed as a deployment, and a service exposing the application to the outside world.

The following sections will delve into the details of each component and its configuration.

### Architecture

#### Database Instance

The project uses a Google Cloud SQL MySQL 8.0 instance named "mysql-db" located in the us-central1 region. The instance is created with the tier "db-f1-micro" and has private IP configured to connect to the default network.

A user named "admin" is created with password stored as a secret. The database connection name is outputted using an `output` block.

#### GKE Cluster

The project creates a GKE cluster named "web-app-cluster" in the us-central1 region. The cluster has two replicas of the web application deployed as a deployment.

The deployment uses a cloudsql-proxy container to connect to the MySQL database instance. The proxy is configured to use the service account credentials from a secret volume.

#### Service

A Kubernetes service named "web-app-service" exposes the web application to the outside world. The service type is LoadBalancer, and it targets port 80 to the deployment's port 8080.
