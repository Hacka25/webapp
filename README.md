Okay, so I need to create a comprehensive technical wiki page about the Project Overview for the given software project. The user has provided several source files from TensorFlow and Kubernetes, which are likely parts of a Containerized Google Cloud application. 

First, I'll start by understanding each file:

- **output.tf**: This seems to be defining output variables related to GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) cluster name and SQL connection details.
- **variables.tf**: Defines project ID, region, GKE cluster name, DB user, and password with some defaults.
- **sql.tf**: Describes the configuration for a Google SQL database instance in GKE, including settings like tier, IP configuration, etc.
- **main.tf**: The main provider definition for the project using the defined variables from variables.tf.
- **gke.tf**: Configuration for the GKE cluster and node pool setup.
- **k8s files**: These are Kubernetes manifests defining services and deployments. They include frontend and backend services, their respective containers with images, ports, environment variables, etc.

The task is to create a project overview using these files. I'll start by outlining the sections:

1. Introduction: Briefly introduce the project's purpose and scope.
2. Architecture Overview:
   - K8s Deployment and Services
   - Google Cloud Container Setup
   - SQL Configuration
3. Key Components with Mermaid Diagrams:
   - Service Dependency Graph
   - Data Flow from SQL to Frontend

For each section, I'll identify the relevant components:

- **Architecture Overview**: The project uses Kubernetes for orchestration with a frontend and backend service setup. Underlying Google Cloud services like GKE and SQL databases are configured using variables defined in variables.tf.
  
- **Key Components**:
   - **Service Dependency Diagram**: Shows how the frontend depends on the backend, which itself depends on Google SQL proxying requests to the database.
   - **Data Flow Diagram**: Illustrates data moving from the SQL database through service account credentials to the frontend.

I'll need to create Mermaid diagrams. For the Service Dependency:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend] --> B[Backend]
    B --> C[Google SQL Proxy]
    C --> D[Google SQL Database]
```

And for Data Flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SQL Database] -->|Services Account Credentials| B[CREDENTIALS]
    B --> C[Google SQL Proxy]
    C --> D[Frontend]
```

I'll make sure to cite each source file where relevant. For example, the deployment setup is in k8s/deployment.yaml and service definition in k8s/service.yaml.

Finally, I'll structure everything into sections with appropriate headings and ensure all key components are covered.

# Project Overview

## 1. Introduction
This project implements a containerized application using Google Cloud technologies, including Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestration and Google SQL for database management. The application is divided into backend and frontend services to separate concerns between database operations and user interface rendering.

### Key Components:
- **Google Cloud Container Engine (GKE):** Manages the lifecycle of containerized applications.
- **Google SQL Database:** Handles data storage and retrieval with built-in proxying capabilities for request handling.
- **Kubernetes Services:** Define service endpoints (`web`, `cloudsql-proxy`) that manage load balancing, ports, and network configurations.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Containerized Deployment
The application leverages Kubernetes to deploy services across multiple nodes:

#### Deployment Setup:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend Service] --> B[Backend Service]
    C[Google SQL Proxy] --> D[Google SQL Database]
```

### 2.2 Google Cloud Configuration
The project utilizes predefined variables for consistent configuration across environments:

#### Key Variables:
- `gke_cluster_name` defined in `variables.tf`.
- `project_id`, `region`, and `db_user/password` from `variables.tf`.

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 Google SQL Database Configuration
The database is configured with the following parameters as shown in `sql.tf`:

#### Resource Setup:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Google SQL Database] --> B[Database Instance]
```

### 3.2 Service Dependency Diagram
The diagram below illustrates how services interact and depend on each other.

#### Service Dependency:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend Service] -->|Dependencies: - Google SQL Proxy, - Database Configuration| B[Backend Service]
    C[Google SQL Proxy] --> D[Google SQL Database]
```

## 4. Mermaid Diagrams

### 4.1 Service Dependency Graph
This diagram shows the dependencies between services.

#### Service Dependency:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend Service] --> B[Backend Service]
    B --> C[Google SQL Proxy]
    C --> D[Google SQL Database]
```

### 4.2 Data Flow Diagram
This diagram illustrates how data flows from the database through service account credentials to the frontend.

#### Data Flow:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SQL Database] -->|Services Account Credentials| B[CREDENTIALS]
    B --> C[Google SQL Proxy]
    C --> D[Frontend]
```

## 5. Tables

### 5.1 Key Variables Table
The following table lists the key variables used in the project:

#### Key Variables:
```markdown
| Variable       | Description                     | Value/Default |
|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------|

## 6. Code Snippets

### Example: `k8s/deployment.yaml`
The deployment of services is defined in this YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: frontend
        image: gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/frontend:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Example: `k8s/service.yaml`
