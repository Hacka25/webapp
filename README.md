# Project Overview

This project aims to deploy a MySQL database instance using Terraform, connect it to a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, and create a deployment and service for a web application. The following sections provide an overview of the project's architecture, components, and data flow.

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

### Database Instance

A MySQL database instance is created using Terraform, which allows for easy management of cloud resources. The instance is configured with a private network and a database version of MYSQL_8_0.

### GKE Cluster

A GKE cluster is created to host the web application. The cluster is configured with two replicas of the app container and a cloudsql-proxy container to connect to the MySQL database instance.

### Web Application

The web application is deployed as a deployment in the GKE cluster, using a Docker image from Google Container Registry (GCR). The application uses environment variables to access the MySQL database instance and credentials are stored as secrets in Kubernetes.

## Data Flow

Data flow in this project is focused on connecting the web application to the MySQL database instance. The cloudsql-proxy container is used to establish a connection between the GKE cluster and the MySQL database instance. The web application uses environment variables to access the database, and credentials are stored as secrets in Kubernetes.

## Conclusion/Summary

This project demonstrates the deployment of a MySQL database instance using Terraform, connecting it to a GKE cluster, and creating a deployment and service for a web application. The architecture is designed to allow the web application to access the MySQL database instance securely.
