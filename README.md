# Project Overview

This project is a cloud-based infrastructure setup that utilizes Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, including Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud SQL, and Cloud Secrets. The primary focus is on deploying a scalable web application with a MySQL database instance.

## Architecture
The architecture consists of:

### GKE Cluster
A GKE cluster named `web-app-cluster` is created using the [k8s/deployment.yaml](k8s/deployment.yaml) file. This cluster contains two replicas of the `app` container, which runs the web application image from Google Container Registry.

### Cloud SQL
A Cloud SQL instance named `mysql-db` is created using the [sql.tf](sql.tf) file. The instance uses a MySQL 8.0 database and is located in the `us-central1` region.

### Secret Management
Secrets for the database credentials are stored in Kubernetes Secrets, which are mounted as volumes to the containers. These secrets include the database username (`DB_USER`) and password (`DB_PASSWORD`).

## Detailed Sections

### Deployment Configuration
The deployment configuration is defined in [k8s/deployment.yaml](k8s/deployment.yaml). The `app` container is configured to use the Cloud SQL instance as its database connection.

### Service Definition
A service named `web-app-service` is defined in [k8s/service.yaml](k8s/service.yaml) to expose the web application to external traffic. The service uses a LoadBalancer type and maps port 80 to port 8080 of the container.

### Output and Variables
The project uses output variables (`output.tf`) to define the Cloud SQL instance connection name, and defines several input variables (`variables.tf`) for project ID, region, GKE cluster name, database user, and password.

## Tables

Here is a table summarizing the database instance settings:
```markdown
| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Database Version | MYSQL_8_0 |
| Region | us-central1 |
| Tier | db-f1-micro |
| Private Network | projects/<project_id>/global/networks/default |
```
## Code Snippets

Here is a code snippet from the [sql.tf](sql.tf) file:
```terraform
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "mysql_instance" {
  name             = "mysql-db"
  database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
  region           = var.region

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
    ip_configuration {
      private_network = "projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default"
    }
  }
}
```
