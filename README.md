# Project Overview
Based ONLY on the content of the [RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]:

## Introduction

This project overview provides an in-depth look at the architecture, components, and data flow of a cloud-based application. The project utilizes Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, including Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud SQL, and Secret Manager.

### Architecture Overview

The application consists of two main components:

1.  **Web App**: A web application running on GKE, using the `gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest` image.
2.  **Cloud SQL**: A MySQL database instance, created using the `google_sql_database_instance` resource.

### Database Setup

The Cloud SQL instance is configured to use a private network and has a tier of `db-f1-micro`. The database user credentials are stored in Secret Manager as a secret named `cloudsql-instance-credentials`.

### GKE Deployment

The web app is deployed on GKE using the `Deployment` resource. The deployment consists of two replicas, each running a container with the `app` image. The containers use environment variables to connect to the Cloud SQL instance.

### Service Definition

A service named `web-app-service` is defined in the `k8s/service.yaml` file. This service exposes port 80 and targets port 8080 on the web app containers.

**Mermaid Diagrams:**

    participant GKE as "Google Kubernetes Engine"
    participant CloudSQL as "Cloud SQL"
    participant SecretManager as "Secret Manager"

    GKE->>CloudSQL: Connect to database
    CloudSQL->>GKE: Authenticate with username and password
    GKE->>SecretManager: Retrieve secret credentials
    SecretManager->>GKE: Return secret credentials

    Note over GKE, CloudSQL, SecretManager: Cloud SQL instance is created using the `google_sql_database_instance` resource.
```

    C[Database User Credentials] -->|Secret|> D[Secret Manager]
    E[GKE Deployment] -->|Deployment|> F[Containerized Web App]

    Note over A, B: The web app connects to the Cloud SQL instance using environment variables.
    Note over C, D: Database user credentials are stored in Secret Manager as a secret named `cloudsql-instance-credentials`.
    Note over E, F: The GKE deployment consists of two replicas, each running a container with the `app` image.
```
