<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to create a technical wiki page for the "Project Overview" based on the provided source files. Let me start by understanding what each file represents.

First, there are several .tf files which seem to be Cloud Functions configuration files. Output.tf defines some variables related to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters and SQL databases. Variables.tf contains project ID, region, GKE cluster name, database user, and password. SQL.tf configures a Google SQL database with specific settings like tier, IP configuration, etc.

Main.tf is a provider definition for Google Cloud, specifying the project ID and region. Gke.tf defines the primary node pool for the GKE cluster, including location and node count. 

Looking at the Kubernetes files, deployment.yaml for the frontend has an app replica count of 2, selector matching 'app', image as a custom build, ports, environment variables, and volumes for SQL credentials. The backend-deployment.yaml similarly sets up another replica, but with specific environment variable values.

Frontend service.yaml defines a LoadBalancer with tier 'frontend' and port mappings. Backend-service.yaml does the same for 'backend' tier, forwarding to the backend deployment.

I should structure this into sections: Architecture Overview, Configurations, Data Flow, Key Components, Mermaid Diagrams, Code Snippets, and Tables. Each section needs to reference specific source files with appropriate citations.

For the architecture, I'll outline the GKE cluster setup, Google Cloud provider, Kubernetes deployments for frontend and backend, and how they connect via LoadBalancers. Configurations will cover variable definitions, SQL database settings, and environment variables.

In Mermaid diagrams, one could show the overall deployment flow from Google Cloud to GKE clusters to Kubernetes services. Another diagram would illustrate data flow from the frontend through the API to the backend.

Tables should list configurations like project ID defaults, region defaults, DB user, DB password sensitivity, etc., with sources cited for each entry.

Finally, code snippets using YAML and JSON from the source files will be included where necessary.

# Project Overview

## Architecture Overview
The system is built on a layered architecture combining Cloud Functions, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Container orchestration with Kubernetes. The architecture follows a microservices design pattern to enable scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability.

### Key Components:
1. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Uses the Google Cloud provider defined in `main.tf` for project and region configuration.
2. **GKE Cluster:** Manages container orchestration with node pools configured using `gke.tf`.
3. **Kubernetes Deployments:** Both frontend (`k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml`) and backend (`k8s/backend-deployment.yaml`) services use deployments to provide replica sets for fault tolerance.
4. **LoadBalancers:** Both frontend and backend services utilize LoadBalancers as service gateways, defined in `frontend-service.yaml` and `backend-service.yaml`.
5. **Cloud SQL Database:** Manages the database layer with specific configurations for authentication and connectivity.

### Data Flow
The data flow follows a RESTful architecture where:
- Frontend applications send HTTP requests to Google Cloud Functions.
- Functions process the requests, marshal them into Kubernetes deployments, and forward them to backend services.
- Backends are responsible for processing database operations using Cloud SQL.

## Configurations

### Project Configuration
The system is configured with a default project ID (`gke.tf`) and region (`variables.tf`), as shown in the following table:

| Configuration | Default Value | Source |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Project ID   | web-app-cluster | `gke.tf:var.gke_cluster_name` |
| Region       | us-central1    | `variables.tf` |

### Database Configuration
The Google SQL database configuration is defined in `sql.tf`, with the following settings:

| Parameter        | Value                  | Source          |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| database_version | MYSQL_8_0             | `sql.tf`         |
| region           | var.region            | `sql.tf:var.region` |
| tier             | db-f1-micro           | `sql.tf`         |

### Environment Variables
Key environment variables include:
- **DB_HOST:** `127.0.0.1`
- **DB_USER:** `admin`
- **DB_PASSWORD:** Sensitive, stored in `db-credentials`

## Key Components

### Google Cloud Provider Definition (`main.tf`)
The provider definition is essential for setting up the project's infrastructure.

```yaml
provider "google" {
  project = var.project_id
  region = var.region
}
```

### GKE Cluster Setup (`gke.tf`)
The primary node pool configuration ensures high availability and redundancy:

```yaml
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name     = var.gke_cluster_name
  location = var.region

  remove_default_node_pool = true
  initial_node_count       = 1
}
```

### Kubernetes Deployments (`k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml` and `k8s/backend-deployment.yaml`)
These deployments manage the scaling of services:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
```

## Mermaid Diagram

## Code Snippets

### Google Cloud Project Definition (`main.tf`)
```gke
provider "google" {
  project = var.project_id
  region = var.region
}
```

### GKE Primary Node Pool (`gke.tf`)
```gke
resource "google_container_cluster" "primary" {
  name     = var.gke_cluster_name
  location = var.region

  remove_default_node_pool = true
  initial_node_count       = 1
}
```

### Kubernetes Deployment for Frontend (`k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml`)
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: frontend
        image: gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/frontend:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Tables

### Project Configuration Summary

| Parameter | Default Value | Source |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Project ID | web-app-cluster | `gke.tf` |
| Region     | us-central1    | `variables.tf` |

This table summarizes the default configurations for the Google Cloud project.

## Conclusion
The system is designed to provide a scalable and reliable infrastructure using a combination of Google Cloud, GKE, and Kubernetes. The architecture ensures high availability with load balancing and fault tolerance through multiple service replicas.
