# Project Overview
Based ONLY on the content of the [RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]:

## Introduction:
This project is a cloud-based application that utilizes Google Cloud SQL to manage a MySQL database instance. The project involves creating a scalable and secure environment for storing and processing data.

### Architecture:

The architecture of this project consists of three main components: Google Cloud SQL, Kubernetes deployment, and an external service. 

*   **Google Cloud SQL:** This component manages the MySQL database instance. It includes settings for the tier, private network, and IP configuration.
*   **Kubernetes Deployment:** This is a scalable and secure environment that utilizes Kubernetes to manage multiple instances of the application. The deployment consists of two containers: one for the web app and another for the cloud SQL proxy.

### Detailed Sections:

#### Database Settings:

The database settings are defined in the [sql.tf](sql.tf) file. It includes the name, database version, region, tier, and IP configuration for the Google Cloud SQL instance.

*   **Google Cloud SQL Instance:** The `google_sql_database_instance` resource is used to create a MySQL database instance.
*   **Database Users:** Two users are created using the `google_sql_user` resource: one with a password set in the [variables.tf](variables.tf) file and another with a default user.

#### Kubernetes Deployment:

The deployment configuration is defined in the [k8s/deployment.yaml](k8s/deployment.yaml) file. It includes settings for the replica count, selector, template, and containers.

*   **Container 1 (Web App):** This container runs the web app and exposes port 8080.
*   **Container 2 (Cloud SQL Proxy):** This container runs the cloud SQL proxy and mounts a secret volume to access the service account credentials.
*   **Secret Volume:** The `cloudsql-instance-credentials` secret is used to store the service account credentials.

#### Service:

The service configuration is defined in the [k8s/service.yaml](k8s/service.yaml) file. It includes settings for the type, selector, and ports.

*   **LoadBalancer:** This service exposes port 80 and maps it to port 8080 of the web app container.
*   **Selector:** The `app` label is used as the selector to target the deployment.
