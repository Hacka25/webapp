Here is the rewritten Project Overview README file based on the provided source files:

# Project Overview
Based ONLY on the content of the [RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]:

**Introduction:** The project is a scalable and secure infrastructure for web applications using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. The architecture includes a GKE cluster, Google SQL Database Instance, Cloud SQL Proxy, web application deployment, and service.

### Detailed Sections:

#### GKE Cluster
The project uses a GKE cluster with one node pool and two nodes, managed by the `gke.tf` file. The cluster is named `${var.gke_cluster_name}` and located in the `${var.region}` region.

**Sources:** [gke.tf:1-6]

#### Google SQL Database Instance
The project includes a Google SQL Database Instance named "mysql-db" in the "${var.region}" region, managed by the `sql.tf` file. The instance is connected to a Cloud SQL Proxy container to connect to the database from within the GKE cluster.

**Sources:** [sql.tf:1-5]

#### Web Application Deployment
The project deploys a web application using a Kubernetes deployment named "web-app", managed by the `k8s/deployment.yaml` file. The deployment runs on the GKE cluster and exposes port 8080.

**Sources:** [k8s/deployment.yaml:1-15], [variables.tf:1-2]

#### Service
The project includes a service that exposes the web application to the outside world using a LoadBalancer type and port 80, managed by the `k8s/service.yaml` file.

**Sources:** [k8s/service.yaml:1-10]

```

**Sources:** [README.md:1-2]

### Variables

The project uses several variables defined in the `variables.tf` file, including:

* `project_id`: The ID of the GCP project.
* `region`: The region where the GKE cluster and Google SQL Database Instance are located (default is "us-central1").
* `gke_cluster_name`: The name of the GKE cluster (default is "web-app-cluster").
* `db_user` and `db_password`: The credentials for the MySQL instance.

**Sources:** [variables.tf:1-4]

### Technical Accuracy
