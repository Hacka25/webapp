# Project Overview

The project overview provides a high-level summary of the architecture, components, and data flow within the project. The following sections will delve into the details of the project.

## Introduction

The project is designed to deploy a web application using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Cloud SQL. The application consists of a frontend and backend, with the frontend serving static content and the backend handling database queries. The project also includes a cloudsql-proxy container for managing connections to the Cloud SQL instance.

### Architecture

The architecture of the project can be visualized as follows:

  A[Frontend] -->| HTTP | B[Backend]
  B -->| TCP | C[Cloud SQL]
  D[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)] -->| Deployment | E[Container]
```

In this architecture, the frontend and backend are deployed as containers in GKE. The frontend serves static content over HTTP, while the backend handles database queries using Cloud SQL.

### Components

The project consists of several key components:

* **Frontend**: A container that serves static content.
* **Backend**: A container that handles database queries using Cloud SQL.
* **Cloudsql-proxy**: A container that manages connections to the Cloud SQL instance.
* **GKE**: The Google Kubernetes Engine platform for deploying and managing containers.

### Data Flow

The data flow within the project can be summarized as follows:

1. Requests are sent from clients to the frontend container over HTTP.
2. The frontend container serves static content to the client.
3. The backend container receives requests from the frontend and handles database queries using Cloud SQL.
4. The cloudsql-proxy container manages connections to the Cloud SQL instance.

### Technical Details

The project uses several technical components, including:

* **Terraform**: A infrastructure-as-code tool for managing GKE and Cloud SQL resources.
* **Kubernetes**: An orchestration platform for deploying and managing containers in GKE.
* **Cloud SQL**: A fully managed relational database service provided by Google Cloud.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the project is designed to deploy a web application using GKE and Cloud SQL. The architecture consists of a frontend and backend, with the frontend serving static content and the backend handling database queries. The project uses several technical components, including Terraform, Kubernetes, and Cloud SQL.
