# Project Overview
Based ONLY on the content of the [RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]:

### Introduction

The project overview is a comprehensive documentation of the architecture, components, and logic of the project. The project consists of multiple Terraform configurations, K8s deployment and service files.

### Detailed Sections

#### Infrastructure Provisioning

The project uses Terraform to provision infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The [output.tf](output.tf) file provides an output for the SQL instance connection name. The [variables.tf](variables.tf) file defines variables for the project ID, region, GKE cluster name, DB user, and DB password.

The [sql.tf](sql.tf) file provisions a MySQL database instance with the name "mysql-db" in the specified region using the Google Cloud SQL API. It also creates a database user with the provided username and password.

#### Deployment

The project uses K8s to deploy a web application. The [k8s/deployment.yaml](k8s/deployment.yaml) file defines a deployment named "web-app" that runs two replicas of the container image `gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest`. The deployment also includes an environment variable for DB_HOST, which is set to `127.0.0.1`, and DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD are obtained from secret values.

The [k8s/service.yaml](k8s/service.yaml) file defines a service named "web-app-service" that exposes the web application on port 80 and maps it to port 8080 in the container.

### Tables

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| project_id | The ID of the GCP project |
| region | The region where the MySQL database instance is provisioned |
| gke_cluster_name | The name of the GKE cluster |

### Code Snippets

Terraform:
```terraform
output "sql_instance_connection_name" {
  value = google_sql_database_instance.mysql_instance.connection_name
}
```

K8s deployment:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:

      - name: app
        image: gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
