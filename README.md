  A[Google Cloud SQL] -->|Connection|> B[Web Application]
  C[Kubernetes] -->|Deployment|> D[Web Application]
  E[Service Account] -->|Credential File|> F[Kubernetes]
  G[Secrets Manager] -->|Secret Key Ref|> H[CloudSQL-Proxy]
```

### Components

The project consists of the following components:

* Google Cloud SQL: A managed relational database service that provides a cloud-based infrastructure for running MySQL databases.
* Kubernetes: A container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containers.
* Web Application: A scalable web application that uses CloudSQL as its backend database.
* Service Account: A type of user account used to authenticate and authorize API requests.
* Secrets Manager: A service that provides a secure way to store and manage sensitive data such as passwords.

### Key Features

The project includes the following key features:

* Scalability: The web application can be scaled up or down based on demand using Kubernetes.
* High Availability: CloudSQL provides high availability for the database, ensuring minimal downtime in case of failures.
* Security: Service account and secrets manager provide secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets from the project:

```terraform
# output.tf
output "sql_instance_connection_name" {
  value = google_sql_database_instance.mysql_instance.connection_name
}
```

```terraform
# sql.tf
resource "google_sql_user" "users" {
  name     = var.db_user
  instance = google_sql_database_instance.mysql_instance.name
  password = var.db_password
}
```

```yaml
# k8s/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
