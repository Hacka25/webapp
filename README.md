Based on the provided source files, this is a project that deploys a scalable and secure infrastructure for web applications using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. The architecture includes:

1. **GKE Cluster**: A Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster with one node pool and two nodes.
2. **Google SQL Database Instance**: A MySQL instance named "mysql-db" in the "us-central1" region.
3. **Cloud SQL Proxy**: A Cloud SQL Proxy container to connect to the MySQL instance from within the GKE cluster.
4. **Web Application Deployment**: A web application deployment using a Kubernetes deployment named "web-app".
5. **Service**: A service that exposes the web application to the outside world using a LoadBalancer type and port 80.

Here is a detailed overview of each component:

### GKE Cluster

The project creates a GKE cluster with one node pool and two nodes, defined in `gke.tf`. The cluster is named "web-app-cluster" and is located in the "us-central1" region. The nodes are configured to use the `e2-medium` machine type.

A(GKE Cluster) -->|connects to| B(Google SQL Database Instance)
C(Cloud SQL Proxy) -->|connects to| B
D(Web Application Deployment) -->|runs on| A
E(Service) -->|exposes| D
```

**Sources:** [gke.tf:1-10]

### Google SQL Database Instance

The project creates a MySQL instance named "mysql-db" in the "us-central1" region, defined in `sql.tf`. The instance is configured to use the `MYSQL_8_0` database version and has a tier of "db-f1-micro".

```yaml
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "mysql_instance" {
  name             = "mysql-db"
  database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
  region           = var.region

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
    ip_configuration {
      private_network = "projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default"
    }
  }
}
```

**Sources:** [sql.tf:1-5]

### Cloud SQL Proxy

The project deploys a Cloud SQL Proxy container to connect to the MySQL instance from within the GKE cluster, defined in `k8s/deployment.yaml`. The proxy is configured to use the `gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy:1.33.0` image and has a command that connects to the MySQL instance.

```yaml
containers:
- name: cloudsql-proxy
  image: gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy:1.33.0
  command: ["/cloud_sql_proxy",
    "-instances=PROJECT_ID:REGION:mysql-db=tcp:3306",
    "-credential_file=/secrets/service_account.json"]
```

**Sources:** [k8s/deployment.yaml:1-5]

### Web Application Deployment

The project deploys a web application using a Kubernetes deployment named "web-app", defined in `k8s/deployment.yaml`. The deployment is configured to use the `gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest` image and has a port of 8080.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/your-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

**Sources:** [k8s/deployment.yaml:1-10]

### Service

The project defines a service that exposes the web application to the outside world using a LoadBalancer type and port 80, defined in `k8s/service.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-app-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

**Sources:** [k8s/service.yaml:1-5]
