# Project Overview
Based ONLY on the content of the [RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES]:

## Architecture

The project utilizes a combination of Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure providers to deploy a web application. The infrastructure is set up using Terraform configuration files. The architecture consists of:

* A Google SQL database instance (mysql-db) running MySQL 8.0 in the us-central1 region.
* Two replicas of a deployment named "web-app" which runs an application container, and a cloudsql-proxy container to connect to the database.

## Components

The project has several key components:

### CloudSQL Proxy
The cloudsql-proxy container is responsible for establishing connections between the application and the Google SQL database. It uses a service account to authenticate with the database.

### Secret Stores
Secrets are stored in a secret named "cloudsql-instance-credentials" which contains the credentials for the cloudsql-proxy container.

## Data Flow

The data flow for this project involves:

1. The application container connecting to the cloudsql-proxy container.
2. The cloudsql-proxy container connecting to the Google SQL database (mysql-db) using the provided credentials.

### SQL Database
The SQL database instance is set up with a specific version and region. It has a private network IP configuration.

## Configuration

The project uses Terraform configuration files to manage its infrastructure. The main.tf file sets up the providers for Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure. The variables.tf file defines several variables that are used throughout the project, including the project ID, region, GKE cluster name, DB user, and DB password.

## Deployment
The deployment.yaml file defines a deployment named "web-app" which runs two replicas of an application container and a cloudsql-proxy container. The service.yaml file defines a LoadBalancer type service for the web-app.

### Mermaid Diagrams

## Tables

Here is a table summarizing the variables defined in the variables.tf file:

| Variable Name | Default Value |
| --- | --- |
| project_id |  |
| region | us-central1 |
| gke_cluster_name | web-app-cluster |
| db_user | admin |
| db_password | (sensitive) |
