# Project Overview

The project is a comprehensive overview of the infrastructure and architecture implemented in the provided source files. This document aims to provide a detailed understanding of the components, data flow, and logic involved in the project.

## Introduction

This project involves setting up a Google Cloud SQL instance and deploying a web application using Kubernetes (K8s) on Google Container Engine (GKE). The project utilizes Terraform configuration files (`output.tf`, `variables.tf`, `sql.tf`, and `main.tf`) to create and manage the infrastructure, along with deployment and service YAML files (`k8s/deployment.yaml` and `k8s/service.yaml`) to deploy and configure the web application.

### Cloud SQL

The project sets up a MySQL 8.0 instance on Google Cloud SQL using the `google_sql_database_instance` resource. The instance is created with a private network configuration, allowing for secure communication between the database and other services.

## Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the project:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Cloud SQL] -->|Database Connection|> B[Kubernetes Cluster]
    B -->|Deployment|> C[Web Application]
    C -->|Request/Response|> D[Service]
```

In this architecture, the Cloud SQL instance is connected to a Kubernetes cluster, which deploys and manages the web application. The web application receives requests from the service and processes them accordingly.

### Key Components

The project involves several key components:

*   **Cloud SQL**: A MySQL 8.0 instance created using Terraform.
*   **Kubernetes Cluster**: A GKE cluster created using Terraform, which deploys and manages the web application.
*   **Web Application**: A deployment YAML file that defines the container image, ports, and environment variables for the web application.

### Data Flow

The data flow in this project involves:

*   The Cloud SQL instance stores data for the web application.
*   The web application receives requests from the service and processes them accordingly.
*   The processed data is stored in the database.

## Code Snippets

Here are some relevant code snippets from the provided files:
```terraform

      targetPort: 8080
```

## Tables

The following table summarizes the key features of the project:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cloud SQL | A MySQL 8.0 instance created using Terraform. |
| Kubernetes Cluster | A GKE cluster created using Terraform, which deploys and manages the web application. |
| Web Application | A deployment YAML file that defines the container image, ports, and environment variables for the web application. |

## Conclusion
