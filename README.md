# Project Overview

Project Overview is a crucial feature that integrates multiple components to provide a comprehensive overview of the project's architecture, data flow, and key functionality. This document aims to provide a detailed explanation of the Project Overview feature, based on the provided [RELEVANT_SOURCE_FILES].

## Architecture

The Project Overview feature is built using Terraform, a popular infrastructure-as-code tool, and Kubernetes (K8s), an open-source container orchestration system. The architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Google Cloud SQL**: A managed relational database service that provides MySQL 8.0 instances for storing application data.
2. **Google Container Cluster** (GKE): A fully managed environment for deploying and managing containerized applications.
3. **Kubernetes Deployments**: Managed deployments of containers, including the Web App and Backend services.

### Data Flow

The Project Overview feature collects data from various sources:

1. **Google Cloud SQL**: Retrieves database instance information, such as name, region, and connection details.
2. **Google Container Cluster** (GKE): Obtains cluster and node pool information, including node counts and machine types.
3. **Kubernetes Deployments**: Collects deployment metadata, including replica counts, container names, and ports.

The collected data is then presented in a structured format, providing insights into the project's architecture and key components.

## Detailed Sections

### Component Overview

* The Google Cloud SQL instance provides a MySQL 8.0 database for storing application data.
* The Google Container Cluster (GKE) hosts containerized applications, including the Web App and Backend services.
* Kubernetes Deployments manage the deployment and scaling of containers.

### Code Snippets

```terraform
output "gke_cluster_name" {
  value = google_container_cluster.primary.name
}

resource "google_sql_database_instance" "mysql_instance" {
  name             = "mysql-db"
  database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
  region           = var.region

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
    ip_configuration {
      private_network = "projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default"
    }
  }
}
```
