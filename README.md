# Project Overview

The "Project Overview" document provides a comprehensive summary of the project's purpose, scope, and high-level overview. This document will cover the architecture, components, data flow, and logic relevant to the project.

## Introduction

This project aims to deploy a scalable web application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with a MySQL database instance using Cloud SQL. The project also utilizes a cloud SQL proxy to connect to the MySQL instance from within the GKE cluster. This document will provide an overview of the project's architecture, components, and logic.

## Architecture

The project consists of the following key components:

*   A GKE cluster with two replicas of a web application container
*   A MySQL database instance using Cloud SQL
*   A cloud SQL proxy to connect to the MySQL instance from within the GKE cluster

### GKE Cluster

The GKE cluster is responsible for hosting the web application. It consists of two replicas of the web application container, which ensures high availability and scalability.

### MySQL Database Instance

The MySQL database instance is used to store data for the web application. The instance is created using Cloud SQL and is configured with a private IP address.

### Cloud SQL Proxy

The cloud SQL proxy is used to connect to the MySQL instance from within the GKE cluster. It allows the web application containers to access the MySQL instance securely.

## Logic

The project logic can be broken down into the following key components:

*   Creating a GKE cluster with two replicas of the web application container
*   Creating a MySQL database instance using Cloud SQL
*   Configuring the cloud SQL proxy to connect to the MySQL instance from within the GKE cluster

### Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets that demonstrate the project's logic:
```
# main.tf
provider "google" {
  project = var.project_id
  region  = var.region
}

resource "google_sql_database_instance" "mysql_instance" {
  name             = "mysql-db"
  database_version = "MYSQL_8_0"
  region           = var.region

  settings {
    tier = "db-f1-micro"
    ip_configuration {
      private_network = "projects/${var.project_id}/global/networks/default"
    }
  }
}

resource "google_sql_user" "users" {
  name     = var.db_user
  instance = google_sql_database_instance.mysql_instance.name
  password = var.db_password
}
```

```
